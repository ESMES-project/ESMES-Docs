# Human-machine interface
* The human-machine interface consists of an LCD graphic display, two LEDs and a few buttons.
* The human-machine interface must interface the following operations:
  * Enable or disable bluetooth.
  * Accept or reject a device that wants to connect to ESMES via bluetooth. 
* The human-machine interface should show information about the current connection and web service status.
* The human machine interface should show error messages.
* Next to the display, there should be two small LEDs, one to indicate that the embedded system is connected to the mains and another to indicate that the embedded system is connected to the battery. If both LEDs are off, the embedded system is off.
